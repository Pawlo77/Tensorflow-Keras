# ml_with_keras

Repository holding homeworks and entire code from <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition</a>.

All chapters have their own .ipynb file.

<i>For clarity all .ipynb files were seperated from their outputs (images and saved models), it was however done without any changes in code - executing them from seperated folder my cause some errors.</i>
