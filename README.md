# Maschine Learning Tour

Welcome to the **ml_with_keras** repository! This repository contains the homework assignments and complete code examples from the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).

Each chapter of the book has its own dedicated `.ipynb` file, allowing you to easily navigate and explore the code examples. 

To provide a clean and organized structure, the `.ipynb` files have been separated from their outputs, including images and saved models. This separation ensures better readability and reduces file size. However, please note that running the notebooks from the separated folder might result in errors due to missing outputs.
